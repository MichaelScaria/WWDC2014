I was the iOS developer on the team, and due to time constraints, I wasn't able to do the image processing natively; I resorted to sending the image data to an OpenCV library on the server. With this app, I had the time to learn how to read in a buffer of raw pixel values and manipulate the final output. For some reason, I wasn't able to fix the color inversion in the picture that replaced the black pixels. I would love to have the opportunity to speak to Apple engineers to identify bugs in my image processing algorithm and make my app better. But bugs aside, in the process of coming to my final idea, I went through several iterations, and along the way, I learned how to identify right angles of dark rectangles with cluster analysis, pick out keys on a keyboard, and manipulate input from the camera to translate into output. Making this app made me realize how much I love computer vision and image processing, and I look forward to exploring even more of AVFoundation in my future apps."}]
