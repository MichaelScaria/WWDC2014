I was the iOS developer on the team and due to time constraints, I wasn't able to do the image processing natively and had to send the data to the OpenCV library on the server. With this app, I had the time to learn how to read in a buffer of raw pixel values and manipulate the final output. For some reason, I wasn't able to fix the color bug in the picture was replaced the black pixels. I would love to have the opportunity to speak to Apple engineers to identify bugs in my image processing algorithm and make my app better."}]
